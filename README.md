# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects by Howard Hsieh

This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of my coursework and assignments. The projects focus on classical statistical methods and modern deep learning techniques for data analysis, image processing, and classification.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Implementation
- **Description:**  
  An implementation of PCA on a wine dataset to visualize the inter-variable correlations, generate scree plots, and analyze the contribution of each chemical component.
- **Key Topics:**  
  Correlation analysis, data standardization, eigen-decomposition, and variance explanation.

### 2. PCA & Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in Image Processing
- **Description:**  
  A project demonstrating how PCA and SVD can be applied to digital image compression. The work includes experiments with different compression ratios using a grayscale image (scooter.jpg).
- **Key Topics:**  
  Image transformation, rank-q approximation, reconstruction quality, and compression ratios.

### 3. Classifier Comparison Experiments
- **Description:**  
  A set of experiments comparing classification algorithms on three datasets:
  - **Dataset 1:** Wine dataset – using multinomial logistic regression, SVM, and neural networks.
  - **Dataset 2:** AT&T face dataset – performance evaluation on facial images.
  - **Dataset 3:** Yale face dataset – further exploration of classification on face images.
- **Key Topics:**  
  Model training, parameter tuning with grid search, cross-validation, and performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score).

### 4. Deep Learning for Face Recognition using CNN (PyTorch)
- **Description:**  
  A deep learning project using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch to perform face recognition on Yale Face images. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model.
- **Key Topics:**  
  CNN architecture design, PyTorch data loading and training routines, model evaluation, and GPU utilization.
